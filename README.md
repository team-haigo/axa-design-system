## Include in your project

### Using the compiled version

The simplest way is to use the files in the `dist/` directory, of type `{.js|.css|.svg}`.

They are compiled to work at least on IE11, and all desktop and mobile browser versions released after IE11 (2013).

Check `dist/demo.html` for a working demo.

### Using the original sources

If you are a bundler user, like Webpack or Rollup, you can directly use the source files in the `./src/components/` directory. Sources are written in Sass and ES Next. Check `package.json` and `.babelrc` to know the babel and sass versions and plugins you will need.

### /!\ Fonts special case

We are using two fonts and their licence disallow us to distribute it to you. To be specific : the file `./src/components/settings/fonts.scss` and its built counterpart `dist/fonts.X.X.X.css` contain the font files but are here only to show a realistic demo. Licensing disallows you to use them directly.

You are supposed to copy or buy and host yourself the font files.
You can download the original _Source Sans Pro Regular_ and _Source Sans Pro SemiBold_ here : https://fonts.google.com/selection?selection.family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,600. For performance reasons, please select a language and convert the files to Woff2 (for performance) and Woff (for compatibility).
The License for _Publico Headline Bold_ DISALLOWS us to distribute to other Axa entities the original file. Please buy a licence from Commercial Type (https://commercialtype.com/catalog/publico/publico_headline/bold), with the Woff2 option (for performance) and Woff (for compatibility).
